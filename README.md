# Neuroevolution Flappy Bird

This is an implementation of a genetic algorithm applied to neural networks controlling agents in a game conceptually similar to Flappy Bird. It is fully implemented in Processing. The neural networks are implemented from scratch. To run, you need Processing, which can be downloaded [here](https://processing.org/). Then open any file in the Processing editor and click the play symbol.
