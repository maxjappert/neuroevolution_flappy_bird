# Neuroevolution Flappy Bird

This is an implementation of a genetic algorithm applied to neural networks controlling agents in a game conceptually similar to Flappy Bird. It is fully implemented in Processing. No linear algebra library was used and the neural networks are implemented from scratch. I.e., feed forward happens by manual matrix multiplication performed with functions implemented by hand.

To run, you need Processing, which can be downloaded [here](https://processing.org/). Then open any file in the Processing editor and click the play symbol.
